## Hello Cargo

- To create a new project via cargo, we go with
`$ cargo new hello_cargo`

- This creates a folder with `hello_cargo.toml` file and `src` folder
- inside the `src`, we see a `main.rs` - this is auto generated by cargo
- also initializes a new git repo with a _.gitignore_ file
- git files won't be generated if you run `cargo new` within an existing git repo
- you can override this with `cargo new --vcs=git`


- *.toml file looks as follows

```
[package]
name = "hello_cargo"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]
```


- note that there is `package` key that has name of the package, version and edition. this configures the package
- there is also `dependencies` key that is currently empty -for bigger projects, we start using other dependencies
- In Rust, packages of code are called `crates`
- Cargo expects source files to be inside `src` folder

## Cargo build

- To build a cargo project, we do

```
$ cargo build
Compiling hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 2.85 secs

```

- This command creates an executable in `target/debug` folder with the file name as project name `hello_cargo.exe`

To run the executable,

```
$ ./target/debug/hello_cargo
Hello, world!
```

- Note that the executable is created in debug folder. If you intend to create a release version that has mode code optimisations

```
$ cargo build --release
```

- release version takes much longer to build and is lighter than debug version - use it for releasing a stable version of executable once all debugging is complete.

- if benchmarking execution time, make sure you are using release versision

## Cargo run

-  We can use cargo run to compile build and run executable in a single command

```
$ cargo run

 Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
    Compiling hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.33 secs
    Running `target/debug/hello_cargo`
Hello, world!
```

- Cargo also provides a command `check` to check if all files are compiled correctly. This does not produce the executable and is much faster. Used by devs to check everything is in order

```
$ cargo check
    Checking hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.32 secs
```
